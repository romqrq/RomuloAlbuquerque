                        <p>Pleased to have you seeing my CV! My name is Romulo Albuquerque, Software Development student at Code Institute in Dublin - Ireland. </p>
                        <p>I am very competitive (especially to myself) but I'm also ethical and don't think I need to step over other people to reach my goals. I have a high drive and energy to back it up.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy leading through trust, creating the conditions for trust to flourish and helping others. I am always looking to improve myself and being better than yesterday.</p>

                        <h3>Music</h3>
                        <p>I absolutely love music. I'm a guitarrist, I can also play base guitar and sing. I've also been learning drums, piano/keyboard and harmonica. Still have the violin on the queue.</p>

                        <i class="fas fa-futbol interests-icon"></i>
                        <h4>Sports</h4>
                        <p>I played semi-pro American Football as a slot receiver and running back I'm also a red belt in karate. I used to compete in rowing and although I don't watch many foorball games I do enjoy playing.</p>
                        <p>Last but not least one of my biggest passions is race driving although my experience hasn't passed the go-karting stage I can't explain how good I feel racing. </p>

                        <i class="fas fa-glasses interests-icon"></i>
                        <h4>Learning</h4>
                        <p>I'm very curious. I want to know more. From fungi that takes over insects nervous systems to wondering if our big bang means our universe came from the other side of a black hole and not necessarily a massive explosion.</p>

                        <i class="fas fa-tools interests-icon"></i>
                        <h4>Fixing Things</h4>
                        <p>I do enjoy fixing things. As a child I did break apart most of my toys (and some innocent home appliances) which had some spare parts when I tried to put them back together. Since I can remember I helped my father fixing the car,
                            plastering and painting the walls in the house and things like that. We were the real life "Bob the builder". As a result I've been learning more at every fixing attempt as it involves research and gauging my own abilities
                            against the challenge.</p>

                        <i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler interests-icon"></i>
                        <h4>Design and Solutions Development</h4>
                        <p>I'm always looking around for alternatives to our problems. I have been developing solutions that combine existing technologies in a unique way that prioritizes the environment and practicity. They go from small city vehicles with
                            electric/human propulsion to aquatic public transport with adjustable draft to adapt to shallow sections of rivers and going under bridges.</p>
                        <p>Since I acquired an arduino board, I've been developing ideas for home automation solutions and some other fun but less useful gadgets such as a light theremin for example.</p>

                            <p>Milestone project 1 of 5 I created the Dobi Automation Solutions after the HTML and CSS modules. It was used a mobile first approach and I prioritized the responsiveness, loading time and intuitivity for this project.</p>
                            <p>For this project, the minimum requisites were to create a band website (all photo, audio and video files provided by Code Institute) with tour dates, embeded video and/or audio files and a gallery with the bands pictures.</p>
                            <p>I decided at the begin of the course to go for high honors and to give all I can to make it work and that's what I did. This project came out after two months managing my time between work, studying, social life and occasional
                                sleep.
                            </p>
                            <p>The satisfaction of having this project deployed and submitted made it worth all the research, debugging and days that I could have said I was too tired to do it.</p>
                            <p>This project was submitted on the 24th of April and I'm waiting on the results.</p>

                            <p>I am very competitive (especially to myself) but I'm also ethical and don't think others success means my failure or that I need to step over other people to reach my goals. I have a high drive and the energy to back it up.</p>

                            <p>I absolutely love music. I'm a guitarrist, I can also play base guitar and sing. I've also been learning drums, piano/keyboard and harmonica. Still have the violin on the queue.</p>

                            <p>I played semi-pro American Football as a slot receiver and running back I'm also a red belt in karate. I used to compete in rowing and although I don't watch many foorball games I do enjoy playing.</p>
                            <p>Recently I took climbing as a new hobby and I'm really excited about it. Great deal of interest comes from the balance between physical strength, technique and problem solving skills to use creatively my technique to overcome the obstacles.</p>
                            <p>Last but not least one of my biggest passions is race driving. Although my experience hasn't passed the go-karting stage, it feels to me as en exhilerating rush of adrenaline and endorphins. </p>

                            <h4>Fixing Things</h4>
                            <p>I do enjoy fixing things. As a child I did break apart most of my toys (and some innocent home appliances) which had some spare parts when I tried to put them back together. Since I can remember I helped my father fixing the
                                car, plastering and painting the walls in the house and things like that. We were the real life "Bob the builder". As a result I've been learning more at every fixing attempt as it involves research and gauging my own abilities
                                against the challenge.</p>

                            <h4>Design and Solutions Development</h4>
                            <p>I'm always looking around for alternatives to our problems. I have been developing solutions that combine existing technologies in a unique way that prioritizes the environment and practicity. They go from small city vehicles
                                with electric/human propulsion to aquatic public transport with adjustable draft to adapt to shallow sections of rivers and going under bridges.</p>
                            <p>Since I acquired an arduino board, I've been developing ideas for home automation solutions and some other fun but less useful gadgets such as a light theremin for example.</p>

                                <p>Milestone project 1 of 5 I created the Dobi Automation Solutions after the HTML and CSS modules. It was used a mobile first approach and I prioritized the responsiveness, loading time and intuitivity for this project.</p>
                                <p>For this project, the minimum requisites were to create a band website (all photo, audio and video files provided by Code Institute) with tour dates, embeded video and/or audio files and a gallery with the bands pictures.</p>
                                <p>I decided at the begin of the course to go for high honors and to give all I can to make it work and that's what I did. This project came out after two months managing my time between work, studying, social life and occasional
                                    sleep.
                                </p>
                                <p>The satisfaction of having this project deployed and submitted made it worth all the research, debugging and days that I could have said I was too tired to do it.</p>
                                <p>This project was submitted on the 24th of April and I'm waiting on the results.</p>

                                    <p>This very page is my second website and the first where I wrote all the code on my own. I am aware that I'm just at the very beginning of this road, it is long and I can't deny how excited I am.</p>
                                    <p>With a changing colors background and JavaScript interactive animations this website was developed with a mobile-first approach giving great responsiveness but uncompromising the user experience on larger screens.</p>
